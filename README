WeeWikiPaint

Before building for the first time:
- Install Node.js [http://nodejs.org/download/]
- Install Git [http://git-scm.com/downloads]
- Clone source repository: 'git clone https://github.com/jamesshore/lets_code_javascript.git'
- All commands must run from root of repository: 'cd lets_code_javascript'
- Compile npm dependencies: 'npm rebuild'

To build:
- Run './jake.sh testacular' (Unix/Mac) or 'jake.bat testacular' (Windows)
- Navigate at least one browser to http://localhost:8080
- Run './jake.sh loose=true' (Unix/Mac) or 'jake.bat loose=true' (Windows)
**Note: not all episodes' source code is in buildable state. The integration
  branch builds clean on Mac and Windows, and is assumed to work on Linux:
  - Change to integration branch: 'git checkout integration'
  - Build: './jake.sh loose=true' or 'jake.bat loose=true'
  - Change back to development branch when you're done: 'git checkout master'

Before deploying for first time:
- Make sure code is in Git repository (clone GitHub repo, or 'git init' yours)
- Install Heroku Toolbelt [https://toolbelt.heroku.com/]
- Sign up for Heroku account
- Run 'heroku create <app_name>' (requires git repository and Heroku account)
- Note: some URLs are hard-coded to weewikipaint.herokuapp.com; you'll need
  to change them to refer to <app_name>. 

To deploy:
- Run './jake.sh deploy' (Unix/Mac) or 'jake.bat deploy' (Windows)
