Engineering Tasks:
- Fix DNS

To Do on current task:
- how to use npm to test dependencies?
    - implement simple checkEngine (see https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/install.js)
    - or simply use npm install as part of testing or integration script
- update notes for new upstream changes
- clean up notes 
- send pull request or message

Future ideas:
- Fix package.json dependancies and shrinkwrap them
- Figure out and write better p[ractices for using package.json for dependencies reply to comments in ll5.mp4
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., Firefox keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and Jakefile.js
- Fix httpGet duplication
- Use NPM to pull in and build/install heroku tools

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows

Fork Notes:
- My package manager has node 0.8.5 installed and I don't
want to install a manually managed node, windows installer is already
at 0.8.8 (looks like most linux distros with a 0.8.x package are on .4
or .5 still, something to consider)

- package.json will also allow you to share code via npm if desired

- looks like the issue w/ nodeunit check marks is probably just an issue
with terminal font in windows, similar result using MS consolas font
in linux

- npm semver's ~1.2.3 := >=1.2.3 <1.3.0

- update package json: set engine version and some sample scripts.

- sample scripts are some what repetitive but might be useful as
project and our work flow evolve

- usages: npm test; npm run-script jake; npm run-script integrate

- jake.sh and jake.bat are no longer needed

- using engineStrict in package json would enforce similar behavior to
previous node version check however the npm website has a stern warning
about doing this needlessly see: https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html

- to enforce proper version with npm use npm set config engineSrict:
true on integration box

- I left package.json engine version as ~0.8.6. 0.9 is unstable and 1.0 is
likely to have breaking changes. This will only issue a warning by default

- Having npm handle the dev dependencies based on project json is a good
idea because if anyone runs npm update they may bring in breaking changes.
Now it should just be bug fixes
